# CSS Katas

A collection of CSS katas

## Getting Started

To start the kata viewer run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The viewer will show you all the available katas with different split views of
the target website and your current version.

To solve a kata open the corresponding index.html, for example
/katas/starter/button/index.html

If you get stuck use the browser developer tools.

## Adding new katas

To add a new kata, first create a new folder in katas with an index.html and
solution.html file. Then add the kata to the list of katas in /katas/katas.json.
